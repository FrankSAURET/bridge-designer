    <p>
       The purposes of the <span class="f4c14">West Point Bridge Designer 2012</span> are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        to provide you with an opportunity to learn about the engineering design process;
      </li>
      <li>
        to provide a realistic, hands-on experience that will help you to understand how civil
        engineers design structures;
      </li>
      <li>
        to demonstrate how engineers use the computer as a tool to improve the effectiveness and
        efficiency of the design process;
      </li>
      <li>
        to provide a tool for visualizing structural behavior--a tool that will help you to
        understand how structures work; and
      </li>
      <li>
        to honor the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point--the first school in the
        United States to offer a formal program of instruction in engineering.
      </li>
    </ul>
